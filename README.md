# Covid19-World-Vaccine-Adverse-Reactions
The importance of evaluating factors such as gender, age, the type of vaccine brand, etc. which are potentially associated with the vaccine recipient-reported adverse reactions after receiving their COVID-19 vaccination.

The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work (Chriscaden, 2022). Countries dealing with existing humanitarian crises or emergencies are particularly exposed to the effects of Covid-19.

Having said that, vaccination is the most important thing we can do to protect ourselves and children against ill health. Vaccines protect our immune system and create antibodies that shield us from diseases. It is much safer for our immune system to learn this through vaccination than by catching the diseases and treating them. 

Vaccines protect many people from dangerous illnesses, but vaccines, like drugs, can cause side effects such as dizziness, fatigue, headaches, and a small percentage of which may be serious and even lead to death. However, not much is known about the factors which are associated with COVID-19 vaccine adverse reactions (Beatty AL, Peyser ND, Butcher XE, et al, 2021) and people of all genders and ages might not know which type of vaccinesâ€™ brand is more effective and suitable for them and the adverse reactions that they might possibly get from the vaccines.

Hence, from this dataset, we set out to find the importance of the relationship between vaccines and if any, how all the surrounding factors, such as their respective gender or age affects case fatality rates or the adverse reactions they had. With this, we hope that people might have a better knowledge and understanding of which type of vaccine is more suitable or effective for them.
